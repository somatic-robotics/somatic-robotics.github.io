Based in the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology and led by Dr Efi Psomopoulou, Assistant Professor at the [University of Bristol](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/efi-psomopoulou) and [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/). Part of the [Dexterous Robotics Theme](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/dexterous-robotics).


### Research areas

EFI Robotics aims to create dexterous and safe robotic physical interactions with the environment or humans in unstructured scenarios by combining control methods and machine learning techniques.
* Stable object grasping and in-hand manipulation.
* Human-inspired human-robot object handover strategies.
* Control of flexible joint robots with variable elasticity.
* Non model-based control of robotic systems with prescribed performance guarantees.
* Bilateral teleoperation with haptic feedback.
