### Project information

What if robots had human-like general dexterity? What would it take to design a controller which achieves this goal and which is not computationally expensive to train or run? How would the control design inform the hardware necessary and vice versa? How would the design of the embodied solution ensure that the system is stable, robust and safe? What would a general purpose robot end-effector look like?

Successful applicants will work towards answering some of these questions by choosing one or a combination of two avenues: 
- (1) explore hardware design for general robot manipulation focusing on optimising degrees of actuation and types of sensing and/or 
- (2) explore dynamically stable control methods for robot grasping and in-hand manipulation which are model-free and object-agnostic. 

Physics-based simulation provides an accelerated and safe avenue for developing, verifying, and testing robotic control algorithms and prototype designs. They rely on the laws of physics to predict the behaviour of the dynamic system of interest and so they use dynamics engines. The designs will be tested and evaluated initially in a simulated environment, but will then be implemented on real robotic platforms.

We seek talented and motivated new PhD students to join our team at the University of Bristol. The successful applicants will be supervised by Dr Efi Psomopoulou and will join the largest centre for multidisciplinary robotics research in the UK, [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/).


### Candidate requirements

Applicants must hold/achieve a minimum of a merit at master’s degree level (or international equivalent) in a science, mathematics or engineering discipline. Applicants without a master's qualification may be considered on an exceptional basis, provided they hold a first-class undergraduate degree. Please note, acceptance will also depend on evidence of readiness to pursue a research degree. 

We strongly encourage applications from STEM with experience in engineering / robotics (e.g., mathematics, control theory, robotics, computer science, mechatronics, or other related engineering discipline). You will need to demonstrate your ability in conducting research in a related field or a strong motivation in learning those skills.

If English is not your first language, you need to meet this profile level: Profile E

### Start date

There are 5 entry points in the Faculty of Engineering:
- The start of the academic year in September
- The first Monday of November
- The start of the teaching block in January
- The first Monday of May
- The first Monday of July

### Application process

At the first stage, please apply through the form available [here](https://efi-robotics.com/join/). Please note that you will also need to apply through the university portal if successful after the first stage.

Personal statement: Please also provide a personal statement that describes your training and experience so far, your motivation for doing a PhD, your motivations for applying to the University of Bristol, and why you think we should select you. We are keen to support applicants from minority and under-represented backgrounds (based on protected characteristics) and those who have experienced other challenges or disadvantages. We encourage you to use your personal statement to ensure we can take these factors into account.

### Funding information

There is no guaranteed funding for this research. There may be opportunities for scholarships depending on the application competitiveness.
