## Realising the Future of Dexterous Robotics with Flexible Electrohydraulic Artificial Muscles

> 2025 - 2028

## Summary

This project aims to develop high-performance, soft artificial muscles called HASEL actuators, which provide transmission-free linear actuation to enable adaptable and cost-effective motion solutions. This project will develop new materials and architectures for HASELs to achieve a step-change in capabilities and realise the holistic performance and versatility required for dexterous manipulators. The team will also explore strategies for integration and control of HASEL actuators to accelerate their incorporation into robotic manipulators.

## Objectives

The University of Bristol part of the project will see researchers led by Dr Efi Psomopoulou, Lecturer in the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology, working with US company Artimus Robotics to develop high performance artificial muscles and integrate them with hand-like robot manipulators. The key will be adopting biologically-inspired design principles to bring together the development of the manipulation framework and the hardware.

The artificial muscles Artimus Robotics are working on are known as HASEL actuators. They will enable lifelike and cost-effective dexterous manipulation for a wide range of markets.

Over the three years of the project, the Bristol research team will work on developing dexterous control frameworks for HASELs and investigating the way the robot manipulator senses the external environment. The intended outcome is a dexterous HASEL-based manipulator that can be evaluated by other ARIA R&D Creators and roboticists in the UK and abroad.

## Project Partners and Funding

The project team is led by [Artimus Robotics](https://www.artimusrobotics.com/) (Dr Nicholas Kellaris) and University of Bristol (Dr Efi Psomopoulou). The award is funded by the [Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA)](https://www.aria.org.uk/) as part of the [Robot Dexterity programme](https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/smarter-robot-bodies/robot-dexterity/meet-the-creators) (Technical Area 1: Novel Hardware).
